# Simple-Search-command

This is a Simple Search command where you can search anything with discord.js. 
You can search Google and Youtube with this. 

# Spaces

When you add spaces it added a '+' to the URL. This is perfectly fine and this
is what adds a space to the search.

# Credits

You do not need to credit me but if you want to you can ðŸ™‚. You  can remove the
comment I added at the bottom. Check out my other projects [here](https://github.com/KK-Designs)
